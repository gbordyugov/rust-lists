# Rust Lists

My read through [Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/).

## Setting up emacs

After installing Rust, in the command line execute

```
rustup component add rls
rustup component add rust-src
```

In emacs, install `rustic` and `lsp-mode`.
